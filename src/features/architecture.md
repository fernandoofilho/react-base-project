This architecture organizes the codebase by features or domains rather than by technical concerns. Each feature folder contains everything related to a specific functionality, such as components, hooks, services, and state management. This modular approach improves code maintainability, scalability, and team collaboration by keeping related code together and reducing dependencies across unrelated parts of the application. It also simplifies navigating the project and makes it easier to isolate and test features independently.
